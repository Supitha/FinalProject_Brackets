							<h1 class="major"> Reflection of the Development</h1>
							
							<p>In this application, Client side is developed using Angular 6 is a JavaScript framework, & server side is developed using Spring boot, java based framework for developing RESTFul web services. We used Maven as the build tool in the project.at the development first, we configure the pom.xml file to include all required dependencies in the project. Here, we configure the spring and all libraries which required JS files.  Due to the available plugins for code generation, documentation etc. that are usually all easy to use makes maven as the only real choice for java build systems. Also, maven takes care of missing libraries, wrong libraries versions, then it compiles, it runs.</p>

							<p>During the integration of these services (Backend & Frontend), Spring framework exposes our services as REST API’s and our client application with Angular6 consumes that server-side JSON data. We stored this application on the same server. It’s just like god matching couple because this architecture is easy to develop, maintain and change. Angular supports this with a web framework that just works with REST.</p>

							<p>When talking about the benefits of technologies and tools that we used, Spring is powerful Java application framework, it lightweight, fast and efficient and made our development lifecycle more productive. It provides infrastructure for building application. Due to Inversion of Control and dependency injection, it helps to achieve simplification and increase testability and it provides better leverage with each line of code written where you know and you can handle each line which is faster and requires less maintenance. If we don't use spring and if we go with J2EE, Code would be too complex because while writing a component we needed to write a set of XML files, home interfaces, remote/local interfaces, etc. along with it. Also, JAX-RS annotation used to associate information with the annotated program element. </p>

							<p>Angular had facilitated faster and easier data binding which doesn't require a developer to intervene at all. Like due to Angular data binding and dependency injection, it eliminated much of the code, a developer would otherwise have to write, since we could able to focus on building applications in a more declarative way, by simply defining an HTML template just like we are used to. We can bind the template to the Model data, and handle the data via a component class. That code is generated for us automatically. And it much more readable. as a Build tool Maven forces to create a standard directory structure quick project setup, no complicated build.xml files, just a POM and go, When the project gets more complex, We have to resolve all dependencies ourselves if we don't use maven. Maven manages to download required libraries and their dependencies. </p>

							<p>And famous git used to keep track of changes in code and data analysis in our projects. As limitations, we identified that the JavaScript Mandatory, due to Angular. Because if JS disable it occurs problem to provide service properly. Also, Scopes are easy to use but hard to debug!!</p>

							<p>At the Spring it requires a little bit of time, due to the learning curve, Sometimes the scheduled job fails because a timeout occurs when it reads information from the external API. Maven also occurs dependency problems, when that the dependency is not defined correctly, also Maven is not a perfect tool, but it will help save time & debugging build problems. We face some difficulties during the development like when loading dynamic data from an API to angular components and the Integration process of Spring & Angular, because of the difference in objectives of both technologies, It occurs some errors, for instance we have to take each and every request relevantly and arrange frontend according to it. We implemented live updating/ dynamically updating graph, which updates when data received, so users can get idea about what’s happening in the market. That was also one of the challenges we faced, when developing & Implementing AI, we had to do some homework out there to figure the suitable model, to building strong analytics methods to keep compete with players, cus it’s not always the best choices out there.</p>

							<p> During the development we had to go through official documentation to Understanding the flow of developing process & how to arrange the development lifecycle and implementation in the project, got to learn different technologies even we had a limited time, Thanks to Agile as a Group we got the idea of how to manage the development process with a team.</p>
