							<p>As u can see in the diagram database hold all the information about accounts, info about stocks, transaction history, relations between them and so on. Here UserEnd is used for carrying on transaction operations. The broker will manage to each kind of account information, history, portfolio and the Stock Simulator is used to handle all kind of orders of trading and the relations between players and system. Broker of the UserEnd will mainly exchange orders with the stock simulator and to get information of stocks. However, based on that information, the player had to make the decision..</p>
							<p>At the Stock Simulator, there are companies that listed on the game. Each company has associated with a share price that has changed over the time.  So the fluctuation of the stock price happens according to the stock value algorithm of the game. And also come up with an assumption like an unlimited supply of stocks. According to the algorithm the deviation of the stock price change within -3 and +3 range. So too with the game base up on this stock prices. Player/ A.I.  come up with a decision to buy or sell stocks.   </p>
							<p>
								Here  UserEnd is the most  important interface between player and the system, So the orders exchanging between  UserEnd and TradingEnd  occupies the majority, for instance, if player wants to buy  stocks, player needs to input stock info (stock name & quantity), according to account information,  then broker will  form an order that can be accepted by stock simulator. The stock simulator will handle the orders and return the request information to the UserEnd and show the correct results. Apart from the relation with broker and stock simulator, there also exchange between players and bank, for instance when user signup/login to the system player should give user credentials to create/ view account, then the bank will routine the results.
